# Programming and Databases

This course focuses on developing and expanding computer science skills, specifically for applications in civil and environmental engineering. Due to digitalization, engineers and other technically interested professionals in these fields increasingly need basic skills in programming, particularly in data management, processing, and analysis. In civil and environmental engineering, this often involves datasets from sensor networks, planning processes, or building databases. A very common tool for working with such data is the Python programming language with its wide range of libraries.

Therefore, this course introduces the fundamentals of programming as well as working with databases and analysis tools in Python. In addition, it covers theoretical computer science foundations and domain-specific development aspects through various examples (e.g., handling spatial data).

The course is divided into three parts:
1.	**Fundamentals**: Provides an introduction to computer hardware and software as well as programming in Python.
2.	**Modeling**: Focuses on modeling problems with functions and objects and solving problems through debugging.
3.	**Databases**: Offers an overview of managing small and large datasets using files and databases.
